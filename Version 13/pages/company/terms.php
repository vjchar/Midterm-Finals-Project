                    <p>These application terms support the booking workflow but do not replace the signed vehicle rental agreement.

                        <p>By requesting or accepting a rental, the renter agrees to the final rental agreement presented by VJ Car Rental. The signed agreement, confirmed vehicle details, and applicable policies govern the rental.</p>

            <h2>Cancellation and recorded refunds</h2>
            <p>Under the current configurable school-project policy, verified payments are fully refundable when an eligible cancellation is approved more than <?= CANCELLATION_REFUND_CUTOFF_HOURS ?> hours before the scheduled pickup. Requests submitted inside that window can still be reviewed by an administrator, but no automatic refund is due under the standard policy. Every refund remains linked to its original verified payment and is shown in the booking invoice/history.</p>
